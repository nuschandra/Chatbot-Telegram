interact with SMIB through event driven mechanical pulses (hard meter)
through serial port (RS232). Key features are:
o Multithreading to improve performance in resource critical embedded linux
system. Reduced pulse missing rate to 5% due to power failure by optimization
and multithreading.
o Write API for simulating (sending and receiving) real time mechanical pulses
of different length (8-120 ms).
o Perform full SDLC cycle of the project following design pattern, prepare unit
test cases, hardware response time test cases, logging etc.
Tools Used: boost library, xplc, gdb, wxWidget, automake, shell script,
Embedded linux, svn, Jenkins, UMLet etc.
