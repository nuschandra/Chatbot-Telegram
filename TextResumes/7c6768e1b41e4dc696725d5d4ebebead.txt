Summary
My PhD study on human genetics using a large amount of
sequencing and microarray data leads me to the world of data
science. I’ve gained years of experience in R programming, data
manipulation, data visualization, and statistical modelling from
multiple research projects. As a self-motivated learner, I keep on
learning new techniques from online courses. In 2019, I finished my
part-time master courses at NUS. Currently, I'm working on industrial
problems including predictive modelling, NLP, audio analysis and
specialised in solving optimisation problems.
